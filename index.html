        <p>My name is Tary-Denise and I am an online student and a
            stay-at-home-mother to 3 beautiful children. I am studying
            Software Development in hopes to begin a career in 
            technology. I wish to eventually branch out into cybersecurity.
            I was born and raised in Northern California within the San Francisco
            Bay Area. My husband and I lived in Salt Lake for a while after getting
            married and decided we wanted to return home and be closer to family.
            My hobbies include gaming and spending quality time with friends and
            family. My favorite foods and snacks include boba and pho.
